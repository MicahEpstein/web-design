		<p>Let's get wild today. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Don't fight it, use what happens. A happy cloud. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted.

		Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Let your heart be your guide. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. See there how easy that is. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there.

		Here's something that's fun. Just use the old one inch brush. Every time you practice, you learn more. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there.

		Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Here we're limited by the time we have.

		Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. I thought today we would do a happy little picture.

		Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Use your imagination, let it go. Anything you want to do you can do here.

		We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. In your world you have total and absolute power. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.
