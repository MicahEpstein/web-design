		<p>Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Let all these things just sort of happen. Let your imagination be your guide. In this world, everything can be happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today.

		I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license.

		Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.

		Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Happy painting, God bless.
