		<p>Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends.

		In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. You can do it. A happy cloud. Let's do that again.

		This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Let your heart be your guide.

		We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. We have a fantastic little sky! You want your tree to have some character. Make it special.

		Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents.

		Now it's beginning to make a little sense. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. In your world you can create anything you desire.

		This is your world. Put it in, leave it alone. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.
