		<p>Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.

		We have a fantastic little sky! I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush.

		Get tough with it, get strong. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer.

		Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring.

		Put it in, leave it alone. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. You can spend all day playing with mountains. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing.

		Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. In your world you have total and absolute power. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Here's something that's fun.
